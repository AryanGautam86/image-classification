<b> #About the Project

This project demonstrates a step-by-step pipeline for classifying images using deep learning. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated on unseen data. It supports data augmentation, model saving/loading, and visual performance tracking.

<b>#Features

- Data loading & preprocessing
- CNN model architecture
- Model training and validation
- Accuracy/loss visualization
- Evaluation using confusion matrix & classification report
- Model saving and loading
